In Jenkins, go to Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration > Git. There, determine the path to git.exe from just that to something like C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe—or wherever you have your git.exe file.

I too had the same error. Please use Java Version 11 instead of Java Version 8. Also, install only the suggested plugins for Git.

You better check out your Manage Jenkins -> Global Tool Configuration. There you need to look at your JAVA_HOME value and the Path to Git executable. I'm using the Docker image with these values:

JAVA_HOME: /opt/java/openjdk
Path to Git executable: git
